# ImagePuller
JS Bookmarklet to pull images from various sites for archival/download

## What is it
A tool that utilises some *undocumented (sorry)* endpoints on https://zlux.us/ to download images/videos easily on compatible websites.

`api_save.js` immediately downloads the file. `api_store.js` stores the file with zlux.us and allows batch downloading using *yet another* undocumented endpoint.

**__Don not use `api_store.js` until I release a tool to download the stored files__**


## How to use
1. Replace `[API KEY]` in both files with an API key obtained from https://account.zlux.us/
2. Copy code and paste into the *URL* field on a bookmark. 
3. Click on the bookmark on compatible pages.
